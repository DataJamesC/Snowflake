-- Preppin Data 2023 Week 1

-- Split the Transaction Code to extract the letters at the start of the transaction code. These identify the bank who processes the transaction
    -- Rename the new field with the Bank code 'Bank'.
-- Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values. 
-- Change the date to be the day of the week

-- Different levels of detail are required in the outputs. You will need to sum up the values of the transactions in three ways
    -- 1. Total Values of Transactions by each bank
    -- 2. Total Values by Bank, Day of the Week and Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)
    -- 3. Total Values by Bank and Customer Code
