-- We want to create a final table for analysis at the level of granularity of one row per Set, with columns for its Year, number of unique parts in the set, total parts, and 'uniqueness'

-- Find the Count of Unique Parts of LEGO (found in exactly one set)
-- Do this by joining the parts table to the set table via the inventory table and storing in a CTE
-- We can then use this CTE to have a qualifying column for unique parts in our overall table

-- This CTE joins the parts table to the set table via the inventory table
