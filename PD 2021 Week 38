--Preppin Data 2021 Week 38 - Trilogies

--Input the data
--Split out the Number in Series field into Film Order and Total Films in Series
--Work out the average rating for each trilogy
--Work out the highest ranking for each trilogy
--Rank the trilogies based on the average rating and use the highest ranking metric to break ties (make sure you haven't rounded the numeric fields yet!)
--We have noticed a slight error in the way that Tableau Prep is calculating this rank, so don't worry if your output is different to ours, we are investigating!
--Remove the word trilogy from the Trilogy field
--Bring the 2 datasets together by the ranking fields
